I am using whole genome sequencing data from the [100k Genomes Project](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/initiatives/100000-genomes-project) to determine the mutations which drive cancer progression and are targetable by available therapies.


### Mutation Signatures

I'm applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NNMF) to determine the distinct patterns of mutations, referred to as signatures, which occur in our cells throughout our lives and during tumourigenesis.
