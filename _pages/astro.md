I did my PhD in astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge from 2018-2021. [Checkout my thesis](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/f80fe053-206b-4911-adc3-d893a191ad34).

I was co-PI of the Completeness of the Gaiaverse project with [Douglas Boubert](https://www.douglasboubert.com/). You can find out all about it at [gaiaverse.space](https://www.gaiaverse.space/).
