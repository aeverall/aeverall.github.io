### EDUCATION
<b> Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, PhD in Astrophysics/Astronomy.</b> <i>September 2018 - September 2021 </i>
- Applied Bayesian statistical methods to correct selection bias
in a survey of 2bn stars and inferred the structure of the
Galaxy.
- co-PI of the Completeness of the Gaia-verse project:
gaiaverse.space,  gaiaverse
- Awarded the Murdin Prize for best published journal paper
by a PhD student. <br />

### WORK & RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
<b> Institute of Cancer Research, Research Fellow.</b> <i>October 2021 - Present</i>
- Decomposed mutation rates in 10k cancer tumours to find underlying processes using non-negative matrix factorisation.
- Implemented novel conditional resampling techniques to control type I error rates in large multiple-testing studies.

<b> Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, Oxford, Assistant Researcher.</b> <i>October 2017 - April 2018</i>
